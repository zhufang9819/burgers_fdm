function x0 = bsv_crossing ( a, b, n, x, u )

%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% bsv_crossing() estimates the location X0 where U(X0) = 0.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This function is intended for a special case, in which we are solving
%    the Burgers equation over an interval [A,B], with positive boundary
%    condition at one end and negative at the other.  In that case, the
%    solution must change be zero at some point X0 in the interval.
%
%    We assume the solution is discretized by a piecewise linear function.
%    We use binary search to locate consecutive indices I and I+1 so that
%    U(I) and U(I+1) are of opposite signs.  We use linear interpolation to
%    estimate the location of X0 between X(I) and X(I+1).

%  Input:
%
%    real A, B, the left and right endpoints.
%
%    integer N, the number of nodes to use between A and B.
%
%    real X(N), the node coordinates.
%
%    real U(N), the computed discretized solution.
%    It must be the case that U(1) and U(N) are of opposite sign.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real X0, a point where the piecewise linear approximation to
%    the solution is zero.
