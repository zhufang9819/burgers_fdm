BSV_TEST08:
  Compare BSV and BSV_UPWIND.
  Upwinding is a scheme which reduces the numerical oscillations
  that can occur as the viscosity in the Burgers equation is decreased.

  The distortion caused by upwinding is visible for N = 21, NU = 0.1.
  The oscillations caused by NOT upwinding are visible for N = 21, NU = 0.01.
